## JavaScript Project with GitHub Actions Workflow
This repository houses a JavaScript project that leverages GitHub Actions for automated workflows triggered on events like pushes and pull requests (PRs). The primary focus of these workflows is to ensure the codebase is tested thoroughly.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the effective utilization of GitHub Actions for automating the testing process. By setting up workflows that trigger on specific events, such as pushes to the repository or the creation of pull requests, we ensure that changes made to the codebase are thoroughly tested before being merged.

Features
GitHub Actions Workflow: The repository is configured with GitHub Actions workflows that automatically trigger on push events and PR creation events.
Testing Automation: The workflows are designed to run tests on the codebase automatically, ensuring that new changes do not introduce bugs or regressions.
Continuous Integration: With automated testing in place, this project follows the best practices of continuous integration (CI), where changes are tested as soon as they are introduced, helping maintain the overall code quality.
